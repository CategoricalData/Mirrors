<h2>A principled way to transform data</h2> 

<p>
Open-source CQL and its integrated development environment (IDE)</a> performs data-related tasks &mdash; such as querying, combining, migrating, and evolving databases &mdash; using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_category_theory">category theory</a>, a branch of mathematics that has revolutionized several areas of computer science.  Open-source CQL is production-ready for single-node in-memory data processing workloads, such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10579">integrating data for data science</a>.  It is being commercialized by <a href="https://conexus.com">Conexus AI</a>; for inquiries, contact <a href="https://wisnesky.net">Ryan Wisnesky</a>.

<h2>Value Proposition</h2> 

	<ul>
	
	<li><b>Reduce risk of failure through artificial intelligence</b>.  CQL contains an embedded automated theorem prover that guarantees the correctness of CQL programs.  For example, <a href="fk.php">a CQL program cannot materialize an instance that violates a data integrity constraint</a>.  Such errors are detected at compile time, when they are easiest to fix. </li>
	
	<li><b>Preserve data quality</b>. High-quality data is expensive to obtain, so it is important to preserve that quality throughout the data life-cycle. CQL programs evolve and migrate data in a mathematically universal way, with zero degradation. As such, data integrated by CQL has many advantages, including perfect provenance: <a href="joinless.php">every row in the output of an CQL program contains a lineage that describes exactly how that row was obtained from input data</a>.</li>
	
	<li><b>Increased developer productivity through higher-level abstractions</b>.  CQL generalizes concepts from SQL using powerful principles from category theory.  For example, <a href="fk.php">CQL generalizes SQL's select-from-where queries from returning single tables to returning many tables related by foreign keys</a>.  Such higher-level abstractions enable developers to be more productive. </li>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Flexible I/O:</b> data can be imported into and exported out of CQL <a href="jdbc.php">by JDBC-SQL</a>, CSV, and more.</li>
		<li><b>Visualization:</b> CQL <a href="images/shot2.png">schemas</a>, <a href="images/shot3.png">databases</a>, etc. can be displayed graphically.</li>
		<li><b>Rich data integrity constraints:</b> CQL schemas contain entities, attributes, and foreign keys - as well as <a href="eqs.php">equations between them</a>.  One use of equations is for <a href="denorm.php">denormalization without the need to manually enforce the consistency of redundant data</a>.</li>   
		<li><b>Computational schemas:</b> <a href="unitconv.php">user-defined functions are part of CQL schemas</a> and can be specified  using java, javascript, or purely equationally.  CQL's theorem prover can reason about user-defined functions and how they relate to data integrity constraints.</li>  
		<li><b>More principled than SQL:</b> relational concepts such as <a href="joinless.php">foreign keys re-appear, in a more principled form, in CQL</a>.  And <a href="quotient.php">CQL provides primitives that SQL lacks</a>.</li>			
		<li><b>100% java</b>.  User-defined functions can be written in java or javascript, and a deep embedding of CQL into Haskell, in collaboration with <a href="https://statebox.org">Statebox</a>, is under development. </li>
		
		<li><b>Stateless</b>.  CQL is not a database management system: it neither stores nor updates data.  It is a <a href="http://categoricaldata.net/cql/fql_def.pdf">canonical functional programming language</a> and IDE whose scalability is similar to that of SQL and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/boris.motik/pubs/bkmmpst17becnhmarking-chase.pdf">chase engines</a>.  </li>
